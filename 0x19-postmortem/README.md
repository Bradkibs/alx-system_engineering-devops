ssue Summary:
On March 1st, 2023, between 2:00 AM and 5:00 AM EST, our web application experienced an outage due to a misconfigured load balancer. This resulted in 30% of our users being unable to access our service during this time, causing significant inconvenience and frustration.

Timeline:

2:00 AM EST: Monitoring system detects increased errors and latency in the web application.
2:05 AM EST: Engineers are alerted and begin investigating the issue.
2:15 AM EST: Initial assumption is that the issue is related to database connectivity.
2:30 AM EST: Database connectivity is confirmed to be working correctly, focus shifts to network connectivity.
2:45 AM EST: Load balancer misconfiguration is identified as the root cause.
3:00 AM EST: Incident is escalated to the network engineering team for resolution.
4:00 AM EST: Load balancer configuration is corrected and tested.
4:30 AM EST: Service is restored to all users.
5:00 AM EST: Monitoring system confirms the web application is operating normally.
Root Cause and Resolution:
The root cause of the outage was a misconfigured load balancer that was inadvertently directing traffic to non-functional application servers. This caused requests to time out or result in errors, leading to the service disruption.

To resolve the issue, the network engineering team corrected the load balancer configuration to correctly direct traffic to functional application servers. Additionally, they implemented additional monitoring to prevent this issue from recurring.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:
To prevent similar issues from occurring in the future, the following measures will be implemented:

Regular review of load balancer configurations to ensure they are correctly directing traffic.
Implementation of automated testing to detect misconfigurations before they cause an outage.
Improved monitoring to quickly identify and address any future incidents.
Tasks to address the issue:

Conduct a review of all load balancer configurations to ensure they are correctly directing traffic.
Develop and implement automated testing to detect misconfigurations before they cause an outage.
Improve monitoring systems to quickly identify and address any future incidents.
Develop and implement a communication plan to keep users informed during any future outages.
In conclusion, the misconfigured load balancer caused a significant outage for our users, resulting in frustration and inconvenience. However, the incident was quickly identified and resolved, and measures are being implemented to prevent future incidents from occurring.
